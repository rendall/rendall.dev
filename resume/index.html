      <h3 class="organization">Disorient</h3>
      <h4 class="position">Event Producer</h4>

      <h4 class="position">Art Director</h4>
      <h4 class="dates">2009&nbsp;-&nbsp;Present</h4>
      <p>
        I have been involved in Disorient at all levels, as all Disorienters
        eventually come to be, from heading up massive events of 1500+
        attendees, creating and managing art projects, and of course hauling
        equipment and cleaning floors. Disorient's organization is itself an
        aesthetic experiment: amorphous and constantly changing, by design.
        Members do whatever is necessary, coming together to form ad-hoc teams
        called cells, that form as needed and disperse when completed. No role
        is too small or too big for a true Disorienter. Disorient is a sound,
        visual and performance art collective which produces events as an art
        form. Over time, it has developed a distinctive aesthetic (called
        "GlamTech") and even its own color scheme (called "Pornj" which is a
        color combining pink and orange).
