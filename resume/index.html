Disorient's organization is itself an aesthetic experiment: amorphous and constantly changing, by design. Members do whatever is necessary, coming together to form ad-hoc teams called cells, that form as needed and disperse when completed. No role is too small or too big for a true Disorienter. Disorient is a sound, visual and performance art collective which produces events as an art form. Over time, it has developed a distinctive aesthetic (called "GlamTech") and even its own color scheme (called "Pornj" which is a color combining pink and orange).</p><p>More info: <a href="http://disorient.info">http://disorient.info</a></p><h3 class="organization">Hack Manhattan </h3><h4 class="position">Founder </h4><h4 class="position">Board of Directors </h4><h4 class="dates">8.2011&nbsp;-&nbsp;11.2013</h4><p>Co-founded and served on the Board of Directors for Hack Manhattan, a non-profit organization dedicated to exploring technology.
