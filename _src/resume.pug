h4(class='dates') 2009&nbsp;-&nbsp;Present
p I have been involved in Disorient at all levels, as all Disorienters eventually come to be, from heading up massive events of 1500+ attendees, creating and managing art projects, and of course hauling equipment and cleaning floors. Disorient's organization is itself an aesthetic experiment: amorphous and constantly changing, by design. Members do whatever is necessary, coming together to form ad-hoc teams called cells, that form as needed and disperse when completed. No role is too small or too big for a true Disorienter. Disorient is a sound, visual and performance art collective which produces events as an art form. Over time, it has developed a distinctive aesthetic (called "GlamTech") and even its own color scheme (called "Pornj" which is a color combining pink and orange).
