This is a quick guide to get a webfont into your website with some attention to web performance and is intended as a starting point for small sites that will write in a Latin alphabet. At the end of the post are some resources for further optimizations, if you choose.

**First**, get your font. This site uses [_Montserrat_](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) but there are lots of other groovy options over at [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com). There are other nifty sites for free fonts, too. If this is your site's text font, grab the files that represent the _regular_, _italic_, _bold_ and _bold italic_ versions.

**Second**, download the font files and host them yourself. **Do not** just throw the link into your html `head` tag like this `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet">`. Among many reasons for not doing this, you would badly slow down your site's load time.

**Third**, _optimize_ your font! [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) is good enough and has a good reputation, but there are other online optimizine services and programs. Your font likely has glyphs and such that you will _never_ use! Get those out of there!

- Upload all of the font files you downloaded in the second step to [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)
- Select all of the font formats except `EOT lite`
- If your font files are TrueType, select `TrueType hinting: Keep Existing`
- Check `Spaces` and `Hyphens` in `Fix Missing Glyphs`
- If you have a fallback font, and you do, pick it in `X-height Matching`
- Under `Subsetting` choose `custom`. This is where you toss most of your font file size.
  - Important: deselect as much as you can. Start with nothing selected.
  - If this is a display font for just the header or logotype
    - Under `Single Characters` add only those characters you will use
  - If this is your website's text font, select these:
    - Lowercase
    - Uppercase
    - Numbers
    - Punctuation
    - (maybe) Currency
    - Look at `Subset Preview` to make sure that you have all the glyphs you will need
    - Add anything missing in `Single Characters`, e.g: `ÄÖÅäöåé` (for this site)
- Enter a memorable name under `CSS: CSS Filename`, e.g. `fonts.css`
- Check the `Agreement` assuming your fonts are legal (and they are, if you got them from the Google site)
- Then `Download your kit`

**Fourth**, unzip and open up your css file (e.g. `fonts.css`). There are a few modifications you will need to make, here.

- Change all of the `font-family` values to the same value.
  - (e.g. Change `font-family: 'montserratbold'` to `font-family: 'Montserrat'`)
- Under each `@font-face` declaration change `font-weight` and `font-style` as appropriate
  - For the _bold_ version of your font, change `font-weight` to `bold`
  - For the _italic_ version of your font, change `font-style` to `italic`
  - For the _italic_ and _bold_ version of your font, change them both
- Change every `url` value to be relative to the `css` file
  - e.g. `url('../fonts/montserrat-bold.eot')`
- Inside of each `@font-face` declaration, add either line: `font-display: swap;` or `font-display: optional;`
  - Or not. Read more about [`font-display` here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display)

**Fifth**, paste the `@font-face` declarations into your site's stylesheet, and move the fonts into your project directory structure. Again, make sure that the paths in the `url` are relative to the `css` file that contains the `@font-face` declarations, and _not_, for example, to the webpage that links to it.

**Sixth**, wire up your `html` tags to the font files, using the name you chose for them in the fourth step. e.g. `html { font-family: "Montserrat", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;}`

Troubleshooting: fire up your browser and see if the fonts are being loaded. If not, the [developer console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) should tell you whence it seeks them.

**Finally**, you have definitely degraded the load time and performance of your site. You have to decide whether it's _good enough_ or if you need further optimizations.
