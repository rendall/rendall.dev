Use git hooks to remind yourself about stashed changes or commits that are works in progress.

**Problem**: In git, you type `git checkout master` (or some branch) and get the following message:

```text
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        src/app/superhero/capeColors.ts
        src/app/villain/evilLair.ts
        src/app/quest/adventures.json
        src/assets/images/unicorn.png
```

You _could_ `git stash` your changes, switch your branch, and then later on switch back and `git stash pop`.

However, what if you do not know _when_ you will switch back? It could be in a few minutes, or perhaps next year. You might _forget_ that you made those changes and then accidentally _redo_ work that you have already done.

On the other hand, the changes aren't really commit-worthy. You don't want them to be part of your commit history. A full `git commit -m "Add QuantumSwarm optimizer"` is not really what you want.

You could add some kind of prefix that means _work in progress_ like `WIP:` to your commit, e.g. `git commit -m "WIP: Don't push this!"` but, again, you do not really know when you will be back to this branch. If you begin work again and accidentally commit after your `WIP:` commit, you will have to mess about with your commit history when and if you notice.

It would be better if you could somehow get a reminder that there is a _work in progress_ on that branch.

**Solution**: Go ahead and add the `WIP:` prefix to your commit message but then use a _git hook_ to remind yourself that there is a `WIP:` commit when you checkout the branch. If you want, you can actually prevent more commits to that branch until the `WIP:` is removed.

Git hooks are custom scripts that can be triggered by various Git events, allowing you to automate tasks and enforce custom rules or workflows. The two we will need are the `pre-commit` hook and the `post-checkout` hook.

## post-checkout hook

`post-checkout` runs after a branch has been checked out. We can use this to echo a reminder when you switch back to the branch with the WIP commit. With this code, you will get a warning message in your console reminding you that this branch is a work in progress whenever you checkout a branch with the last commit prefixed by `WIP:`

```bash
$ git checkout amazing-feature-branch
Switched to branch 'amazing-feature-branch'
WARNING: There are WIP commits that need attention:
ed38de4 - WIP: almost amazing work in progress
```

Create a file named `post-checkout` in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository and paste the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

WIP_COMMIT=$(git log --grep="^WIP:" --format="%h - %s")

if [ ! -z "$WIP_COMMIT" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: There are WIP commits that need attention:"
    echo "$WIP_COMMIT"
fi
```

Or, if you prefer colors!

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# ANSI escape code for bright yellow text
BRIGHT_YELLOW="\033[93m"
# ANSI escape code for bright orange text
BRIGHT_ORANGE="\033[38;5;214m"
# ANSI escape code to reset text color
RESET="\033[0m"

WIP_COMMIT=$(git log --grep="^WIP:" --format="%h - %s")

if [ ! -z "$WIP_COMMIT" ]; then
    echo "${BRIGHT_ORANGE}WARNING:${RESET} There are WIP commits that need attention:"
    echo "${BRIGHT_YELLOW}$WIP_COMMIT${RESET}"
fi
```

Make the file executable with `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout`.

## pre-commit hook

The pre-commit hook will run after you type `git commit` but before committing. Use this to ensure that you do not add another commit over your `WIP:` commit. If your last commit has the `WIP:` prefix, print an error and then prevent the new commit:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Also amazing"

Error: The last commit message has the 'WIP:' prefix. Please remove or amend the commit before proceeding.
```

Create a file named `pre-commit` in the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository and paste the following code:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Check if the last commit message starts with `WIP:`
last_commit_message=$(git log -1 --pretty=%B)
if echo "$last_commit_message" | grep -q "^WIP:"; then
    echo "Error: The last commit message has the 'WIP:' prefix. Please remove or amend the commit before proceeding."
    exit 1
fi
```

Make the file executable with `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`.

This hook will prevent you from committing if the last commit message starts with `WIP:`. When you get this message, you can do:

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

This will un-commit your `WIP:` changes and let you continue your work.

## .bashrc check

The `post-checkout` hook only runs when you checkout a branch and not when you open your terminal with that branch already checked out. If you close your IDE and then open it again, you will not get a warning. If you want to be sure that you get the `WIP:` warning then, too, `git` does not have a hook for that.

If you're using a Linux variant, you can add a check to your shell script. When you open your terminal, the check will run and print the `WIP:` warning. Add the following function to the end of your `.bashrc` (or whatever shell configuration file your shell uses):

```bash
function check_wip_commits() {
    local wip_commits=$(git log --grep="^WIP:" --format="%h - %s" 2>/dev/null)

    if [ ! -z "$wip_commits" ]; then
        local bright_orange="\033[38;5;214m"
        local reset="\033[0m"

        echo "${bright_orange}WARNING:${reset} There are WIP commits that need attention:"
        echo "${wip_commits}"
    fi
}

check_wip_commits
```

Then you can restart your terminal or type `source ~/.bashrc`

## post-checkout for stash

There is also the option of reminding yourself that you have uncommitted changes in your _stash_. With this code, you will get a warning like this:

```bash
$ git checkout amazing-feature-branch
Reminder: There's a stash for the current branch (amazing-feature-branch):
stash@{0}: WIP on amazing-feature-branch: 7a17a51 Add minions
Use 'git stash apply' or 'git stash drop' as needed.
```

To add this reminder, open `./git/hooks/post-checkout` and add the following to the end. If you already have the `#!/bin/sh` header from earlier, do not add that. Skip adding the color variables if you already have those, also.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

BRIGHT_YELLOW="\033[93m"
# ANSI escape code for bright orange text
BRIGHT_ORANGE="\033[38;5;214m"
# ANSI escape code to reset text color
RESET="\033[0m"

current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
stash_info=$(git stash list | grep "on ${current_branch}:")

if [ -n "$stash_info" ]; then
  echo "${BRIGHT_ORANGE}Reminder:${RESET} : There's a stash for the current branch ($current_branch)"
  echo "$stash_info"
  echo "${BRIGHT_YELLOW}Use 'git stash apply' or 'git stash drop' as needed.${RESET}"
fi
```

Remember to make the file executable with `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout`,
if you did not yet already.

Now, when you switch to any branch with changes in stash, you will get a reminder.
