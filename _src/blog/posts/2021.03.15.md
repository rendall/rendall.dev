_Quest Driven Development_ is an expressive approach to writing game stories and interactive fiction that leaves coding and implementation to software, so writers can focus on narrative and world-building. This approach can highlight inconsistencies or problems as potentially clashing narrative branches are woven together, allowing a writer to correct errors or inconsistencies as they go.

Currently _Quest Driven Development (QDD)_ is in the concept phase, but the problem and solution space is generally well understood. This post is a brief overview of its ideas.

The approach itself and infrastructure tooling is [open-source](https://github.com/rendall/quest-driven-development) (nothing hidden, and you can contribute) under the [standard MIT License](https://github.com/rendall/quest-driven-development/blob/master/LICENSE) (use it however you want, commercially or not, heck launch a business with it), and uses the [all-contributors specification](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/overview), which honors every contributor and contribution, both technical and non-technical.

## Introduction

Story-rich games, interactive fiction, branching narratives of all sorts, including even bog-standard fetch quests, all have the same underlying abstract structure. Leveraging principles from theory and practice in other areas of software development can improve the design, writing and programming of branching narratives.

A branching narrative creator can, using _Quest Driven Development_, focus on the over-arching story, narrowing in on story details as needed, all while leaving actual implementation details such as variable values, error checks and if-then conditionals to software infrastructure and tooling.

When mature, this approach allows:

- automatically testing the narrative structure for errors and incompletable states;
- tracking narrative events and their consequences in world-building;
- visualizing the narrative structure as a whole or in part;
- interactively navigating and "getting a feel for" the narrative structure without needing to encode changes into the game platform;
- automatic code generation using the narrative itself as a template, rather than programming the narrative by hand;
- enable porting of game narratives into different platforms;
- data-gathering about the popularity and difficulty of various narrative structures.

As time goes on and the approach matures even further, it should be possible to procedurally generate coherent, unique branching narrative structures, for nearly infinite narratives.

Given the similar structures that quests share with well-understood problems in software development, current best practices and solutions to these problems can be leveraged to handle or even solve them.

### Brief Taxonomy of Interactive Narrative Structures

If you're familiar with interactive and branching narratives, feel free to skip ahead!

_Branching Narrative_ is a general term for the class of stories in which player actions can decide how a story proceeds. [Black Mirror: Bandersnatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror%3A_Bandersnatch) is one example of this story as applied to film. [Life Is Strange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Strange) is an example applied to the medium of video games. [Dictionary of the Khazars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_the_Khazars) is (arguably) an example of branching narrative applied to the traditional book medium.

_Interactive_ here means that the story somehow reacts to the player. (And _player_ here means the viewer or reader or player, irrespective of the medium.)

#### Linear Narrative

Stories throughout history have overwhelmingly been _linear_, in which the story begins and proceeds inevitably to its conclusion, _Once upon a time..._ to _...happily ever after_.

Often _linear narrative_ is contrasted with _interactive narrative_, but sometimes a narrative can be _interactive_ but nevertheless _linear_: there are no branching states irrespective of the player's actions. While usually considered to be a flaw, it sometimes can be an effective story-telling device. One example is the interactive fiction [Photopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopia).

#### Quests

A _quest_ is a goal-oriented subset of the general _branching narrative_, in which generally a character succeeds at a task and is rewarded or fails and is not. As a minor point, _Quest Driven Development_ itself can apply to any style of branching narrative, not only quests. _Quest Driven Development_ is however a snappier name than _Branching Narrative Driven Development_

#### Choose Your Own Adventure

_Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA)_ is a subset of _branching narrative_ in which a player's input is limited to a specific and explicit set of choices, e.g. _"To enter the cave, turn to page 25. To cross the river on the log, turn to page 42"_. The actions that exit the current narrative state are clearly listed as a multiple choice. While _Quest Driven Development_ can handle this style of narrative, it is not restricted to that.

As an aside, though, I might argue that _nearly all_ branching narratives ultimately resolve to this kind of structure. In most game platforms, the player has a wide variety of verbs and actions available all the time, but only a small subset of these actions at the right point will move the _narrative_ along. These actions that exit state are most often _hidden or obscured from the player_, and part of the challenge is to discern clues in the environment that indicate these transitional actions. The above _CYOA_ example for instance might have in an Interactive Fiction platform only this description: _"You are in a forest. To the north is a cave. A river flows nearby, across which lays a log."_ The player is invited to examine elements of the environment to decide what actions will move the narrative ahead.

## Theory

Quests and branching narratives in general correspond to some well-understood mathematical constructs in mathematics and computer science. If this does not interest you in the least, feel free to skip down to the [Practice](#practice) section below.

### Finite state machines and Statecharts

A [finite state machine (FSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) is an idea from computer science, an abstract machine which has a specific number of _states_. A [_state_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)#Program_state>) can here entirely describe the player's position along a narrative arc as the result of any past decisions or actions. Some of the possible decisions at a given state will _transition_ the narrative arc from the current state to another state. In this way, a quest can be described as a finite state machine (or, rather, this essay applies only to those interactive narratives that fit the structure of a finite state machine). A _terminal state_ for our purposes is a state that ends, or narratively concludes, the quest.

The [statechart](https://statecharts.github.io/) modifies the concept of finite state machines to more easily apply to real-world solutions, to allow for hierarchical structures and state machines that coordinate in parallel. This could allow for the FSM that represents the narrative structure to overlay another FSM that represents locations in the game, for example.

### Graph theory

A finite state machine, and therefore a quest, can be described as a directed graph, where _nodes_ of the graph are _states_, and _edges_ of the graph are specific actions or decisions which transition the quest from one state to the next. This is wonderful news, because graphs, finite state machines, and therefore quests, have available an intuitive visualization and a rich knowledge base for reasoning about them.

### Regular expressions

A finite state machine can be entirely described by a regular expression. This is a minor point that may not be useful for _writing_ quests, but may be useful for _testing_ quests. What this would mean in practice is that a regular expression engine could be leveraged to test whether any given sequence of actions would lead to an ending (or _terminal state_).

## Practice

A _state_ as described above can roughly correspond to a scene in a play or an episode in a long-arc TV series: the scenario the characters find themselves in are due to the result of all previous decisions, and the _transition_ corresponds to decisions or actions that move characters into new scenarios. A narrative constructed with this structure can leverage the theory outlined above _and_ the practices outlined below.

### Development environment

As an _approach_ rather than as a specific software solution, _Quest Driven Development_ can accommodate all manner of writing styles and preferences.

In the abstract, a branching narrative writer will need an interface that outputs structured data objects which in turn are consumed by other software (perhaps directly by a game platform, or by a visualizer, or an interpreter). The actual nature of the development should be flexible enough to accommodate any sort of file format, from Word and text files, to spreadsheets, dynamic forms and widgets, to visual programming.

Practically, the structured data for a single scene of a larger narrative would look something like this:

```json
[ {
  name: "Stella reads the journal",
  description: "After Fisk's betrayal and the loss of her medallion,
  Stella in despair flips randomly through Grandma Pluck's journal.
  There, she discovers how exactly the cult intends to summon the
  End of Times. But what does she do with this knowledge?",
  actions: [
    {decision:"tell-fisk", result:"fisks-second-betrayal"},
    {decision:"do-nothing", result:"eschaton-arrival"},
    {decision:"try-stop-cult", result:"disturbing-revelations"}
  ]
  ...
},
{
  name: "Stella does nothing",
  description: "Succumbing at last to exhaustion and fear, Stella
  lays under her fluffy down comforter and curls into a ball,
  rocking herself to sleep. The Final Battle is decisive. Entropy's
  victory has always been inevitable, and now is its time.
  Unleashed at last, Fenris, the Howling Wolf Always Hungry,
  devours the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, Stella, Fisk, the cult, the
  Earth, Time, and finally, itself. Nothing remains, but deep cold
  and darkness, for eternity",
  actions:[]
}
]
```

Software can consume and use such objects to map out the narrative structure, test it and even transform it into cold, hard code.

### State management

The consequences of potential decisions can overlap and interfere with each other. In a large game, a narrative can become inconsistent: a decision made by the player may not be reflected in the game state later, and almost never in conversation with a minor character at any point. Worse, certain quests or the game itself may [enter into an incompletable state](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=quest+incompletable&ia=web), infuriating and disappointing players.

Under the hood, a state is a collection of variables and their values, and a transition is a change to the value of one or more of these variables. Manipulating values directly is to transition unpredictably in an unmapped, unexplored state machine. Keeping track of all of these values so that they behave in an expected and consistent way is called _state management_, and there are approaches to do this.

In _Quest Driven Development_, the writer is encouraged to think of state not as a collection of variable-values, but as a branching-point in an narrative. Transitions are not to be thought of as changes to variables, but as possible actions by the player that advance the story.

### Automated testing

The internet is replete with plaintive posts from disappointed or infuriated players who cannot complete a quest or an entire game because of a broken quest. _Quest Driven Development_ allows the narrative structure to be automatically explored and tested, flagging potential errors and inconsistencies. The narrative structure can be developed and tested in parallel and distinct from the underlying game platform.

### X Driven Development

Generally, _X_ Driven Development (e.g. _Test Driven Development_, _Behavior Driven Development_, _Feature Driven Development_) are approaches to _software_ development that emphasize the _X_ part, usually by crafting the development environment so that the _X_ can be written or developed first. In _Test_ Driven Development, developers write tests that fail, and then write software so that the test will pass. Similarly, in _Behavior_ Driven Development, development teams decide what behavior the software should have and write _expressive_ synopses of this behavior.

The advantages of this approach is that the application has a series of automated tests that describe what the software should do, and importantly, can identify immediately when later additions to the software introduces bugs.

#### Quest Driven Development

Likewise, _Quest Driven Development_ emphasizes the stories that a game wants to tell. As the game progresses, a series of quest objects are created that can be continually tested against, to ensure that later additions are coherent, potential bugs or narrative consistencies are highlighted, and [all quests are all completable](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=game+quest+incompletable&ia=web).

## Hence

_Quest Driven Development_ is a only an idea in its initial, conceptual phase. To be able to move beyond that into actually helping the community of story-driven game developers, I propose this list of future steps.

- Contributions: As a greenfield, interdisciplinary concept, the field is wide open for contributions.
  - Ideas for improvement
  - User-interface and developer experience
  - Helpful theory and resources
  - Game developers and writers who would consider using it:
    - What would you need to begin using the QDD approach?
      - Tooling?
      - Development environment?
      - Tutorial?
- Praxis: Culturally, the idea must be wedded and welded to actual development, not merely remain a theoretical idea
  - Pay particularly close attention to how game developers work, and interactive fiction writers write, and what they say
- Culture:
  - Friendly and open, to newbies and non-technical people in particular,
  - Honoring of all contributions from all contributors
  - As an untested idea, _QDD_ very well may be an impractical dead end.
    - Advocates but not activists
    - Practice detachment from outcome

I have had this on my mind for a long time, and judging by some of the response, others have as well. Let's cooperate and bring some beauty to the world!

### Roadmap

- Blog posts that analyze and visualize in-the-wild branching-narratives
- An [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) that outputs a structured data file
  - Also accepts a file and populates its interface with the structured data
- Requests for comment, discussion and resources
- Small games and quests, with input from active game developers
- Tooling, such as JSON schema, testing frameworks, user interfaces
- Automated code generation
  - Tools that transpile structured data to code
  - Unity plugin
- Procedural generation
- This is undoubtedly a years-long project, so expectations of leisurely progress should be set accordingly

## Addenda

These are questions and concerns that came up from helpful first draft readers or after publishing:

_"Is this a no-code way for non-coders to create games?"_

Not necessarily, but perhaps. It's more of an approach that enables creators to focus on narrative flow, getting out of the weeds of thinking in terms of variable values and more in terms of scenes and their transitions, the various ways the player can exit from those scenes. A side-effect of this approach should be more robust and error-free narratives, perhaps more complicated or sophisticated narrative structures, and perhaps an opening of the field to non-coders. But, it is by no means the only approach nor even the best approach for certain kinds of narrative or creative process.

_"The structured data code example above looks like it would list explicit actions, and the player then picks one. Isn't that a Choose Your Own Adventure?"_

In a word, no. Well, not necessarily. The primary focus of the _QDD_ approach is on the _narrative_ and not on its presentation. The decisions listed above are only those which will transition the narrative to the next state. While it may be atmospherically important for the action _"look into the mirror"_ to have a response like _"The boils have spread below your hairline. You look so tired, Stella. Maybe it would just be easier to give up?"_, narratively speaking, that action does not drive the narrative itself forward (the next stages appear to be rather dark for poor Stella, judging by the state ids!).

_"How then would a writer encode 'atmospherics' using the QDD approach?"_

This is new to me, too, so I can't give a definite answer other than to say I know there is a good answer. One approach is to add something like this to the actions array, above:

```json
{
  "decision": "look-mirror",
  "onTransition": "You look so tired, Stella. Maybe it would be easier to just give up?",
  "result": "loop-back"
}
```

Or maybe the platform itself has generic responses to actions that are not explicitly covered by the narrative-state-machine. Or such responses are set as context variables by specific states. I mention these as possibilities, but hopefully probably definitely alternative solutions will reveal themselves as this idea and tooling matures. Maybe you have a good idea?
