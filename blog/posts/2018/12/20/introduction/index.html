        <p>Hello.</p>
        <p>
          My name is Rendall. I am a software developer, father and New York
          City expatriot living in Finland, so this blog will revolve around
          these topics. This is a quick introductory post to say hello and set
          intentions for the blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first intention is to free my thoughts to the bright light of
          extrospection, to let myself and others see what has accreted there.
          Whether interesting, boring, odd, illuminating, useful, insightful, or
          trite: all will be revealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second is to commit to committing; never to stealth edit a post,
          but clearly denote any changes; to be upfront about previous and
          ongoing mistakes, unwarranted convictions, blunders, misapprehensions
          and peculiar notions.
        </p>
        <p>The third is to write more.</p>
        <p>
          These intentions are for me, and not for you, dear reader. If I
          quietly correct a typo, for instance, and you drag me for violating my
          second intention, I will tell you to stuff it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is a bit of a continuation of
          <a href="https://rendallkoski.blogspot.com/">another</a>, but since I
          am taking ownership of the hosting, coding and designing of this one,
          it feels like a clean break and true start.
