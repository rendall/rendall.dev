        <p>
          I have lived now in Finland for nearly 7-and-a-half years! That's a
          long time. Longer than I expected when I arrived here from New York
          City. It's probably time to admit to myself that I'm not going
          anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          This understanding mandates a shift in mindset in my relationship to
          this land and its culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/img/juhannus.jpg"
            alt='"Summer, outdoors, friends chatting"'
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          I know enough to get by. I have <em>suku</em>, or ancestry, here. I
          have close friends. I have <em>perhe</em>, family. I have a career
          that supports me. I've never experienced culture shock. I know the
          rough outline of Finnish history.
        </p>
        <p>
          My Finnish language skill is adequate for getting through basic
          situations. I have met Anglophone immigrants living here longer than
          I, some of them for over 3 decades, some Americans, who aggressively
          speak no Finnish at all. Now <em>that</em> takes a level of dedication
          that is impressive in its own way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/img/mikkeli.jpg"
            alt='"Boy jumping on a trampoline in front of a Finnish farmhouse"'
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, my <em>adequate</em> knowledge has been a barrier to deeper
          understanding. I cannot yet hold an extended conversation in Finnish.
          I couldn't tell you anything about contemporary Finnish literature. I
          tend to avoid reading notices written in Finnish. I'm expressing all
          of this in relation to the Finnish <em>language</em> but this of
          course extends to <em>culture</em> and <em>society</em>. There are
          depths that I'm not accessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="/img/kekkonen.jpg"
            alt='"Urho Kekkonen smoking a peace pipe, wearing a feathered headdress"'
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          My blog itself has languished. A public presence is unsettling to me.
          I'm not a performer. I do not aspire to be perceived as a
          thought-leader. I have a sense of humor which gets me in trouble. When
          programming, I tend to solve the problem at hand, write a few notes
          and then move on. I like things to be neatly complete. My writing is
          stilted, using too many big words.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I think I can <em>use</em> this blog, this resource, to
          bolster my learning, about Finnish language and culture, or anything,
          really. If I can write about something, explain it, then I can absorb
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To that end, I present a new tag,
          <a href="/tags/finland"><em>finland</em></a
          >, that will be thoughts and writing about this land in which I find
          myself, of pine-forests, lakes, and quiet, earnest people. I will
          definitely continue to write about any tech topics that strike my
          fancy, but not only.
