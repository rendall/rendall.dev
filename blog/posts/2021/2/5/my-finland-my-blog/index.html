<p>I have lived now in Finland for nearly 7-and-a-half years! That's a long time. Longer than I expected when I arrived here from New York City. It's probably time to admit to myself that I'm not going anywhere.</p>
<p>This understanding mandates a shift in mindset in my relationship to this land and its culture.</p>
<p><img src="/img/juhannus.jpg" alt="&quot;Summer, outdoors, friends chatting&quot;"></p>
<p>I know enough to get by. I have <em>suku</em>, or ancestry, here. I have close friends. I have <em>perhe</em>, family. I have a career that supports me. I've never experienced culture shock. I know the rough outline of Finnish history.</p>
<p>My Finnish language skill is adequate for getting through basic situations. I have met Anglophone immigrants living here longer than I, some of them for over 3 decades, some Americans, who aggressively speak no Finnish at all. Now <em>that</em> takes a level of dedication that is impressive in its own way.</p>
<p><img src="/img/mikkeli.jpg" alt="&quot;Boy jumping on a trampoline in front of a Finnish farmhouse&quot;"></p>
<p>Still, my <em>adequate</em> knowledge has been a barrier to deeper understanding. I cannot yet hold an extended conversation in Finnish. I couldn't tell you anything about contemporary Finnish literature. I tend to avoid reading notices written in Finnish. I'm expressing all of this in relation to the Finnish <em>language</em> but this of course extends to <em>culture</em> and <em>society</em>. There are depths that I'm not accessing.</p>

<p>My blog itself has languished. A public presence is unsettling to me. I'm not a performer. I do not aspire to be perceived as a thought-leader. I have a sense of humor which gets me in trouble. When programming, I tend to solve the problem at hand, write a few notes and then move on. I like things to be neatly complete. My writing is stilted, using too many big words.</p>
<p>However, I think I can <em>use</em> this blog, this resource, to bolster my learning, about Finnish language and culture, or anything, really. If I can write about something, explain it, then I can absorb it.</p>
<p>To that end, I present a new tag, <a href="/tags/finland"><em>finland</em></a>, that will be thoughts and writing about this land in which I find myself, of pine-forests, lakes, and quiet, earnest people. I will definitely continue to write about any tech topics that strike my fancy, but not only.</p>
