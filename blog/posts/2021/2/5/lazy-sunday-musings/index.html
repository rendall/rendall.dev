          Simple Comment <a class="direct-link" href="#simple-comment">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I've been spending time creating a commenting system called
          <em>Simple Comment</em> and I'd like to talk about some of the
          learnings <a href="#learnings-def">1</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          First, about <em>due diligence</em>. It's well known that, whenever
          starting a new project, it's essential to survey the field to see what
          exists and what <em>has existed</em>: learn if what you intend to
          build has already been built, learn your potential competitors and
          collaborators, what mistakes have been made, leverage existing
          knowledge so that you have a clear idea of what it all entails.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I thought about what I wanted in a commenting platform, I wanted
          it to be useable for static sites such as this one, useable with my
          current host, Netlify, GDPR compliant and no-track, offer complete
          trust with respect to user data, light-weight, and, since traffic here
          is exceedingly low, free-tier or self-hosted. As well, I wanted to
          open-source and promote the API schema itself as a standard so that
          other systems could interoperate with it. And, in terms of personal
          development, I didn't want it to be a toy project, but something that
          could actually be used by others, possibly turned into a business.
        </p>
        <p>
          My survey found
          <a
            href="https://github.com/rendall/simple-comment/commit/fedbeb91890263c3b783c92402ee97058e518f9b#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5R198"
            >12-13 commenting systems</a
          >, including Facebook Comment plugin and Disqus, these last two are
          not at all what I want, and the rest missed one of the other of my
          list above. And so, one day, unexpectedly, suddenly, I set aside the
          project I had been devoting several months to, and was about to
          imminently launch, and got to work on <em>Simple Comment</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without going into too much detail, on November 6th I began and on
          January 27th I had an MVP <a href="#mvp-def">2</a>. It surprised me
          how long it took, but I got hung up on at least two areas that I
          needed to learn about: cross-site requests and authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other day because of a Hacker News post, and its excellent
          comments, I also learned that there are not 12-13 available commenting
          systems, but <em>34</em>. Some of them absolutely occupy the same
          niche as <em>Simple Comment</em> but are more mature
          <a href="#mature-def">3</a>. There are lots of other devs who had the
          same idea I did. Some of whom tried to make a viable business and
          actually closed it down.
        </p>
        <p>So! Learnings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Due diligence: I searched online for about 3 hours and I would
              have thought this would be enough. But instead I confirmed a
              preconception that my ideas are completely original and no other
              developer has my concerns. Actually, there are lots of other devs
              who not only share my concerns, but started awhile ago!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Authentication: It's a beast. As with the comment system itself,
              my due dilligence was lacking. There are a fair number of
              open-source solutions that I could have used, and it would have
              shaved weeks off my time. I'll go over authentication in some
              future post.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Cross-site: I'm super glad to have learned about cross-site
              requests and implemented an example. There are lots of
              undocumented gotchas, particularly privacy-related extentions and
              using <em>incognito</em> (or <em>private</em>) mode, that will
              interfere with expected behavior. I'll write a post about
              <em>cross-site</em> requests in future
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I will continue to work on <em>Simple Comment</em> and dogfood
          <a href="#def-dogfood">4</a> it. After all, no one is doing
          <em>exactly</em> what I'm doing and the
          <a
            href="http://www.fotocommunity.com/info/Helsinki_Bus_Station_Theory"
            >Helsinki Bus Station Theory</a
          >
          applies: stay on the bus and eventually, with effort, the project will
          diverge from the others to become uniquely valuable. I'll just do it
          with a more full awareness of how exactly I'm using my time.

        <h2 id="finnish-translation">
          Finnish translation
          <a class="direct-link" href="#finnish-translation">#</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Saw a Tweet today that is about at my ability to read. Challenging,
          not too challenging. I'm going to do a live translation of it here.
          Hopefully the Tweet is innocuous and not touching any cultural
          landmines that I'm currently unaware of, as a foreigner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tweet is
          <em
            >&quot;Oon sporassa klo 14.42 menossa koronatestiin. Sporaan nousi
            lauma keski-ikäisiä päissään laulamaan eppu normaalia. Mikä vaihe
            pandemiaa tää on&quot;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Oon sporassa klo 14.42 menossa koronatestiin</em> : &quot;I'm on
          the tram at 2:42pm going to a corona test&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Sporaan nousi lauma keski-ikäisiä päissään laulamaan eppu
            normaalia</em
          >: This one is challenging. My guess is &quot;Onto the tram came a
          middle-aged (<em>lauma</em> - busker or singer?) to sing (laulamaan)
          (<em>eppu normaalia</em> - epä - &quot;not&quot;? normally)
          abnormally?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Mikä vaihe pandemiaa tää on</em>: &quot;What a change this
          pandemia is&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, to see what I can find out about <em>lauma</em> and <em>eppu</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok! Fortunately, there is an online definition for
          <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lauma#Noun"><em>lauma</em></a
          >: &quot;crowd, mob, flock (large uncontrolled group of people)&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          And likewise for
          <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eppu#Noun"><em>eppu</em></a
          >: first-year schoolchild
        </p>
        <p>
          These make me realize that I don't actually remember or know what
          <em>päissään</em> means...
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/p%C3%A4iss%C3%A4%C3%A4n#Adverb"
            ><em>Drunk!</em></a
          >
          (literally <em>into their heads</em>)
        </p>
        <p>
          My updated translation: &quot;Onto the tram came a pack of drunken
          middle-agers singing like schoolchildren.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Given this was a Saturday, this is not such an unexpected occurrance
          in Finland. That plus the <em>normaalia</em> makes me think I'm not
          getting the translation exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
          What does Google Translate say it means? &quot;A herd of middle-aged
          people rose to their heads to sing Eppu normal&quot; [eye-roll emoji]
        </p>
        <p>I have to make a phone call.</p>
        <p>
          Well! <em>On ollut kehitystä</em> There have been developments!
          Apparently <em>Eppu Normaali</em> is a band, and the meaning of the
          sentance is &quot;A pack of middle-agers got on the tram singing Eppu
          Normaali&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us listen together:
          <a href="https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9043B1DF2AFBBA4E"
            >https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9043B1DF2AFBBA4E</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I wonder what specific song it was. There is a subsequent tweet and
          replies, so let's see if there is more information.
        </p>
        <p>... No.</p>
        <p>
          <em>Eppu Normaali</em>: My snap judgement - purely by sound without
          knowing anything about the lyrics - is that it's rather innocuous pop
          music. Let's see what Wikipedia has to say...
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppu_Normaali"
            >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eppu_Normaali</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Well. Shit.
          <em
            >&quot;The band is the best-selling music artist in Finland, with
            certified sales of nearly two million records&quot;</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          When in my last blog post I expressed my gaps in understanding Finnish
          <em>culture</em> in terms of gaps in Finnish <em>language skill</em>,
          this is a great example of what that means.

        </h2>
        <p>
          A few months ago I was
          <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25088348"
            >whining on HN</a
          >
          about the lack of tooling around <em>Open API 3</em>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The best in class right now is Open API 3, which offers a way to
            describe endpoints, verbs and expected responses with a JSON schema.
            And even so, working with it feels primitive compared to, for
            instance, front end focused tools with bundling, type checking,
            package management and so forth.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            With Open API 3 / Swagger, you hand write a YAML or JSON file or
            fill out a form and have it done for you, but there is no code
            completion nevermind AST analysis. And now you have a schema, but
            there is no automatic link between that schema and the backend code,
            nor error typing, nor validation. The code generation options that
            are available are clunky and not customizable. If you change the
            code, you just have to go over the schema by hand again and make
            adjustments. Unit tests help of course, but you build it yourself
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Well! There is a project that apparently serves this very need:

          As a Finnish-language learner, I have a lot of admiration for
          foreigners who strive to learn Finnish as adults. I'm not talking
          about becoming fluent. Actually succeeding and becoming fluent feels
          to me now like a god-like superpower (hopefully, one day, I will read
          this and think &quot;becoming fluent wasn't <em>that</em> hard&quot;).
          It isn't so much that the Finnish language is difficult, although it
          is, it's that it's so easy <em>not</em> to learn it. Finns rank among
          the highest in the world in facility with English
          <a href="#finglish">5</a>, and it's outright rare to meet a Finn who
          is not fluent in English.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gen is a Japanese fellow who conceived a desire to learn Finnish and
          emigrate to Finland about 3 years ago. He's proficient and relentless
          and I find that inspirational and aspirational. This post isn't a
          profile about him so much as an acknowledgement of him. His YouTube
          channel is here:

          <em>Learnings</em> (learning <em>plural</em>): I don't know if
          &quot;learnings&quot; (learning plural) is an industry-wide,
          business-wide or Nordic regionalism, but it means &quot;things we have
          learned&quot; from some endeavor.

          <em>Minimum viable product</em>: Industry term meaning that your
          project is minimally useable and, if it's a business, you can begin to
          market it.
        </p>
        <p>
          3 <a id="mature-def"></a><br />
          <em>Mature</em> in the sense of further developed with more features,
          and not <em>necessarily</em> in the sense of &quot;adult&quot;, but I
          am willing to entertain that criticism as well!
        </p>

          <em>dogfood</em> is shorthand for the phrase-and-metaphor &quot;eat
          your own dogfood&quot;. It refers to the necessity of a company or
          developer to use the product that they are developing. After all, if
          you the developer can't use your own product, how do you expect anyone
          else to use it? In my case, I'll continue to use it for this blog,
          even if there are more fully featured alternatives.

          Apparently there are people who go around measuring this stuff, and
          ranking European countries about it. I'm not looking it up right now.
          But the methodology involves pollsters stopping people in the street
          and quizzing them on English skill. Anyway, when this happens, Finland
          and all the Nordic countries rank the highest outside of England.
